# Key-Word-In-Context
Program used to get the key words in a determined sentence, ordering them to display maximum 'in context' information (Combination of circular shifts).

This project goal is to make it modular in a way i can change almost every module of the program, for example, the data input, whitout modifying evey other dependency.

Use:
```
make all
./bin/main.exe ./resources/input.txt ./resources/stop_words.txt
```
